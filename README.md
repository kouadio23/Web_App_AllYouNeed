# Overview

This project demonstrate my ability to manipulate python langage with django platform to create a web application.

This web application provides any sort of information about my country which Ivory coast, specifically in entertainment, travel, tourism, restaurant etc... It allows the user to add, delete upload and update posts about the information provided. 

To start the application we run a django command that will open the browser. When on the site, we need to login to access the content or register to be a user.


This software when fully completed will be a personal project I intend to put on the market for my home country.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
